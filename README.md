# E-credit Application
This project is a web application designed to automate the process of applying for bank credit. It is built using a **microservices architecture** and incorporates multiple technologies to manage users, credit applications, and ensure system security. The application enables clients to submit credit requests online, and administrators can manage and evaluate these requests efficiently and securely.
